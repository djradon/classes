## [[rl.vallaki]]

- @rudolph: I've been developing this persona of @ricktavio for three years.
- @tserro: If we help you, how will you be able to track us appropriately?
- @rudolph: There's a [[tower|rl.baratock-tower]] on [[rl.lake-baratock]]. I might be there. But if our destinies are aligned, then we will meet.
- @rudolph: I've been travelling around trying to gather as much knowledge as I can. I have a lot of knowledge around killing vampires. @straad controls the foul beasts of this land, and they are his spies. He can turn to mist. After destroying him, he must return to his coffin. They cannot enter a residence without invitation. They can be burned by running water. 
- they talk some more
- @rudolph: Let me get this straight, you traded away two sunlight-producing items?
- [[g.sil-zin-tserro]] [[p.lookAt]] @gunaar angrily
- @rudolph: [[rl.fellholt]] is where the order of the bronze dragon tried to take down @straad. They fought to the death. There were rumors of betrayal.
- @sil: Maybe there's some clues there... or weapons.
- @rudolph: I'm sure of it.
- they review the cards: 
  - [[rl.abbey-of-st-markovia]] is where we'll find the Broken One
    - @rudolph: perversions and maddness! I don't know why anyone would want to go there
  - [[rl.yesterhill]] had amulet
    - @rudolph: a dark and corrupted place. creatures of the woods worship corrupted demi-gods, and they've turned the forest into something monstrous
  - [[rl.white-mountains]] 
    - @rudolph: when I entered [[rl.morovia]], I entered through the [[rl.svalich-woods]]. As I was passing off [[rl.luna-lake]] on a barge, I noticed a huge bridge made of white stone with mountains rising on either side. [[g.gypsies]] mentioned golden guardians above watching over a tower.  
- @rudolph: Vampires are always at their strongest in the lairs. It will be unlikely for him to leave. I am prepared to never return from his castle. Perhaps I shall survive, but this is the greatest vampire... I have no plans beyond this, and nothing to return to.
- [[g.shadows]] decide to proceed to Fellholt first, then on to [[rl.krezk]] and the [[rl.abbey-near-krezk]]
- @rudolph: glory and strength until we meet again. 
- [[g.shadows]] [[p.attemptTo]] [[p.proceedTo]] [[rl.vallaki-inn]]
- [[g.shadows]] notice a spy
- @zintara fires a bow and badly injures a spy, who runs off around the corner
- @gunaar invokes @bjorn who snuffs... "this way", follows to the town square, and points his snout at the mansion on the far side of the square. The curtains are heavily draped, and ruffle a bit.
- @zintara to @bjorn: good dog, bjorn!
- while standing there, an older man and woman exit and hustle down the road.
- @gunaar [[p.goes]] around to the back door
- @zintara [[p.enters]] through the front door and catches the faintest edge of bloody boot.
- [[@mousy-voiced-maid]]: you can't go up there
- @bjorn leads them down hallways and to a door. Inside, the room is filled with dolls that all look the same. 
- @bjorn points to the door to the west: "smell dogs in here"
- @bjorn [[p.leads]] [[g.shadows]] into a new room with a trap door.
- @sil [[p.picksUp]] @bjorn and flies up through the trap door
- the room is empty except for a desk an lantern, leads to a big room full of old junk. A path leads through the junk into a door with a skull carved into it and a sign that says "all is not well"
- [[g.shadows]] hear two male voices
- @sil tries the doorknob
  - @sil triggers a [[ddt.glyph-of-warding]]

### attic battle with grim men

- out of the crates and boxes, six [[ddc.vampire-spawn]] [[p.emerge]]
- @victor [[p.casts]] 
- @izek-strazni [[p.attacks]] @zintara with [[ddc.battleaxe]]
- @sil [[p.casts]] [[ddt.fireball]]
- @zintara [[p.yells]] a prayer to the fire gods and Mielikki
  - @victor [[p.dies]]
    - poison cloud dissipates
- @sil [[p.telepaths]] "somebody pick up my body"
- a [[ddc.vampire-spawn]] [[p.claws]] @sil, mortally
  - @sil [[p.falls]] from the ceiling to the ground
